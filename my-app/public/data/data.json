It provides computing as a utility, which has emerged as a commercial reality. It typically involves over-the-Internet provision of dynamically scalable resources. In other words, CC is a style of computing in which virtualised resources are provided as a service over the Internet.  Nowadays, cloud services are increasingly common technologies used by many organisations to add flexibility, efficiency, and innovation to their business.  This module starts by introducing the key concepts behind Cloud Computing (distributed and parallel computing). Next, it covers the cloud computing deployment and delivery models, large-scale systems architectures, with a specific focus on some existing data stores, distributed computing and Distributed file systems (e.g., Hadoop File System, Google File System, \u2026). Then it focuses on techniques for processing big data (the Map/Reduce model), and all the necessary programming tools that simplify the generation of Map/Reduce implementation of applications, such as Apache Pig, Hive, \u2026 Other concepts, such as security and the economics of the Cloud, will also be covered.

A Time Series is a set of measurements taken at regular intervals over a period of time.

This course will show how to model such data and how using those models forecasts and predictions can be made.Time series analysis is not a new subject, however there have been many advances in recent years and the 2003 Nobel prize in Economics was awarded to Engle and Granger for their work in time-series econometrics. This course will cover both traditional methods and more modern approaches to Time Series Analysis.
